# A virtual keyboard I made for physics class. But its also me blowing into glass bottles.

tldr: the physics class I took for junior year had a handful of no-prompt projects. an issue with this is: i am not creative. fortunately, as the most recent topic covered was waves, the idea of measuring and recording notes in glass bottles was offered to me. i liked the idea but wasn't too keen on recording a full octave. thats how we got here. yeah .

### todo
